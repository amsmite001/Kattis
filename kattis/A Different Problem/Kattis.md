Write a program that computes the difference between non-negative integers.

## Input
Each line of the input consists of a pair of integers. Each integer is between 0 and 1015 (inclusive). The input is terminated by end of file (hit enter).

## Output
For each pair of integers in the input, output one line, containing the absolute value of their difference.

## Running the file
```
python3 adifferentproblem.py
```

The input is looking for two integers, i.e.
```
10 12
```
When done, just hit enter.

For running the test cases,
```
python3 adifferentproblem.py test
```
