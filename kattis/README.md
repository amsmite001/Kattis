(Note, Sort of Sorting went down in points recently, to 2.5. The recorded score above is the one at the time I completed the problem.)

__Self graded score__: 98% - 
Just couldn't get one test case to work, but all other requirements are satisfied. (And by math, each test cased problem is worth 1.8%. Multiply that by 5 (for the ones I completed) and that's roughly 8%.)
